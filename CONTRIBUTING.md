# Contributing to fusion

Thanks for taking the time.

## Setup

```console
pnpm install
```

Requires Node 22+ and pnpm. The `hcn` CLI (`npm install -g @dungle-scrubs/harness-cli-normalizer`) is needed for any live pattern run - workers are spawned through it.

## Everyday commands

```console
pnpm build        # bundle dist/cli.js
pnpm test         # vitest suite (unit + engine tests with a fake spawner)
pnpm lint         # biome check
pnpm typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
```

All four pass before every merge; CI runs the same set on each pull request.

## Making changes

- Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `test:`, `refactor:`. Versions and the changelog are derived from them by release-please.
- A new pattern or tier-1 function ships with its doc under `docs/methods/` in the same pull request (ADR-0001), plus a selection rule with a counter-rule in `fusion skill` output.
- Claims flow through the flat schema in `src/claim.ts`; unknown fields stay rejected and provenance stays tool-stamped. The RFC and the ADRs under `docs/adr/` are the design record - read the governing one before changing what it covers.
- Tests exercise the public seams (the fuse functions, the engine with a fake spawner, the CLI envelope); avoid asserting implementation shape.

## Pull requests

Open one against `master`. Squash merges only. The PR template asks for the verification evidence; comment reviews run on every change.
